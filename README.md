# IBM-Watson-Assistant-Chatbot-
I developed a chatbot for the challenge IBM Challenge-Chatbot | FIAP - 2020, which i had 4 days to finish.  I did a chatbot to help a hypothetical language school. However, without integration with the database, it was generic and could be used by more schools, or even institutions in other areas that needed registration.  https://ibm.co/336r6NR
